  "description": "You work for an IT department of a small company. Your HR department asked you to create a workflow that automatically creates Virtual Machines for employees based on a .csv list. The HR department will deliver you an updated list periodically via E-Mail. The list only contains current employees – if an employee left the company, he/she won’t be listed in the list and his/her VM shall be deprovisioned. Unfortunately, that’s the best your HR department can do at this point.",
